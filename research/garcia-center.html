                                                Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a common method of 3D printing in which
												filament is melted and extruded onto a build platform. Currently, bond strength
												between deposited threads suffers as a result of the poor thermal properties of
												available printing materials, which also limit the usefulness of FDM printing in 
												applications involving heat transfer. Polylactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene (PP)
												are two thermoplastic polymers used in FDM printing, but both exhibit low thermal
												conductivities. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and boron nitride (BN) nanoparticles 
												are thermally conductive particles that can be dispersed into polymer matrices
												to improve the materialâ€™s thermal properties. This research was focused on fabricating nanocomposites 
												from the aforementioned thermoplastics and nanoparticle additives and extruding filaments for 
												thermal conductivity testing. Printed samples were also tested and it was found that
												the additives significantly improved the thermal conductivities of both filaments
												and printed products. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed
												that the additives improved fusion between extruded threads in the printing process
												and that the nanoparticles in printed samples were oriented in the direction of heat
												flow. This research was conducted at Stony Brook Univeristy as part of the
