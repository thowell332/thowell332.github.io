                                                At the base of every forest ecosystem are mast, or the
                                                fruits of trees and shrubs, which includes acorns, hickory
                                                nuts, and beech nuts. Mast play several
                                                fundamental roles in ecology, from sustaining animal
                                                populations to influencing reproduction patterns. 
                                                Variations in masting cycles can cause
                                                fluctuations in animal populations and can provide
                                                important information relating to weather patterns and
                                                other environmental factors such as climate change.
                                                One of the main goals of the Duke Forest is to study
                                                masting cycles in order to better understand forest trends
                                                and to educate the public about the environment. To
                                                conduct this research, the Duke Forest staff collects
                                                thousands of mast to study. The original method of 
                                                mast collection employed by Duke Forest
                                                researchers was a simple laundry basket with a net on 
                                                top to separate out sticks and leaves. However, it
                                                takes Duke Forest researchers a significant amount of 
                                                time to sort the collected mast by genus and to
                                                remove all other organic debris by hand for testing 
                                                after collection. Thus, the Duke Forest researchers
                                                sought a design which would ultimately remove organic 
                                                debris from the collected mast as well as sort
                                                the mast by genus. In the Fall of 2018, this design 
                                                project was assigned to a group of first-year Duke engineering students in
                                                partnership with Duke University’s First Year Design 
                                                experience to give practical, real-world applicable
                                                tasks to incoming freshman engineers. The project was 
                                                then continued in the Spring of 2019 by a smaller
                                                team. The final design for the mast collector is shown 
                                                in Figure 1.

                                                <br/><br/>
                                                Before mast can be sorted by genus, they first need to be isolated from other natural debris. In pursuit of
                                                this goal, the device was designed with a clear focus on the efficacy of the collector: accurately filtering
                                                sticks, leaves, and other debris while still collecting all of the mast. Other factors were also considered,
                                                such as the cost, weight, and durability of the collector. The final mast collector design is
                                                split into two parts: an upper collector and a lower collector. 
                                                The as-built prototype is shown in Figure 2.
                                                <br/><br/>
                                                <span class="header-3">Upper Collector</span>
                                                <br/><br/>
                                                To prevent larger branches from falling into the device and clogging up the lower
                                                collector, the upper filter was created using a PVC 
                                                frame and a flexible mesh net. The goal of
                                                the upper filter is to block out larger debris that 
                                                could possibly impede the collector’s function by
                                                blocking the metal ramp while still allowing mast to 
                                                pass through, allowing for the collector to operate
                                                for a longer time before requiring maintenance. A closer 
                                                look at the upper collector is presented in Figure 3.
                                                <br/><br/>
                                                <span class="header-3">Lower Collector</span>
                                                <br/><br/>
                                                The lower collector, shown in Figure 4, is made out of a strong and
                                                lightweight polycarbonate material and held
                                                together by lightweight 3D printed plastic joints
                                                and metal L-brackets, which allows for ease of
                                                transportation and maneuverability, along with
                                                making the entire design modular. The two ramps are 
                                                made from aluminum sheet metal. This
                                                component of the device separates mast from
                                                other tree debris using their kinetic energies.
                                                Since mast are more spherical in shape, they are
                                                able to roll down the ramp while other debris
                                                slides at a much slower speed. This difference
                                                in speed allows the mast to launch over the gap 
                                                between the ramp and the collection bin while sticks and
                                                leaves fail to clear the gap. The unwanted debris 
                                                then slides into the gap and out of the bottom of the
                                                mast collector onto the forest floor.

                                        <p>
                                            At the end of the Fall 2018 semester, the team presented the design 
                                            and prototype at a poster session. This poster features the prototype 
                                            constructed before the spring redesign, so it is made from wood 
                                            instead of polycarbonate. It is also considerably larger than 
                                            the redesigned iteration and lacks the upper collector portion.
