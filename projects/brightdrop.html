                                                Introduced by General Motors in 2021, BrightDrop is a modern 
                                                effort to reimagine first to last mile delivery operations
                                                through the use of electric vehicles. This project is focused
                                                on the "last 100 miles" of delivery; that is, moving packages 
                                                safely and efficiently from a delivery truck to the customer's door. 
                                                Our vision, in collaboration with the team from General Motors 
                                                is to design and build a modular, electrified vehicle for 
                                                transporting packages and lab equipment around the Duke 
                                                engineering campus. The final design for the vehicle 
                                                is shown in Figure 1. The immediate use case for our design is 
                                                to help the engineering lab staff at Duke University. 
                                                The minimum design criteria for the device as specified by 
                                                the client are listed below in Table 1.

                                        <p>
                                            The body of the cart was designed with two hinged doors 
                                            on the front and back faces and two hinged doors on the top face. 
                                            These will allow easy access to the interior of the cart 
                                            from either the front or the top of the device. There is 
                                            one removable shelf in the middle of the cart, which can 
                                            be adjusted to different heights as needed. The overall 
                                            dimensions of the cart body, shown in Figure 2, were chosen with consideration 
                                            to typical doorway and elevator dimensions. Another image of 
                                            the cart body is shown in Figure 3 with all of the doors 
                                            in an open position. In terms of material selection, the 
                                            frame of the cart body is constructed from 80/20 aluminum 
                                            T-slot beams and the side panels are cut from acryllic.

                                            The base of the vehicle, which includes the powertrain and 
                                            the wheels, is made from a modified electric wheelchair. 
                                            A CAD model of the wheelchair base is shown in Figure 4, 
                                            with modified areas highlighted in red or blue. The section 
                                            highlighted in blue will be sawed off to allow the interior of the cart base 
                                            to be flush with the attachment pole. The back wheels,  
                                            highlighted in red, will be separated from the rest of the 
                                            chassis and attached to the rear end of the cart body. This 
                                            will involve using an angle grinder to cut through two 
                                            small welding points and reattaching via nuts and bolts 
                                            to the 80/20 frame of the body. Extending the wheelchair 
                                            chassis will increase the length of the wheelbase, improving 
                                            the storage capacity and stability of the vehicle.

                                        <p>
                                            The proposed control flow diagram for the vehicle is shown 
                                            below in Figure 6. Starting with the inputs, two single-axis 
                                            joysticks were selected along with a trigger for the electromagnetic brakes. 
                                            These input modules will be mounted to the handle of the device, 
                                            with one joystick controlling forward/reverse motion and 
                                            the other controlling left/right steering. Signals from 
                                            the input modules will be fed into an Arduino UNO and 
                                            transformed into control signals for the motor controller. 
                                            The selected controller is a 40A dual-motor controller 
                                            from Pride Mobility. In this module, the control signals 
                                            will be processed to determine the required speeds of each 
                                            motor to achieve the desired motion and the motors will be actuated accordingly.
                                            For powering the circuit, the 24V power supply will be 
                                            connected directly to the motor controller and will be 
                                            connected to the Arduino via a 24V/5V DC step down converter.

                                        <h2>Future Work</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            The next steps in developing the proposed electric vehicle 
                                            are to order the selected components and begin construction. 
                                            The team plans to first focus on achieving successful motion 
                                            control of the vehicle using manual inputs. Once the device 
                                            is built to support the required payload as specified in 
                                            the design criteria and can be controlled manually, 
                                            the minimum design criteria will be satisfied. At this 
                                            point, the team has selected a number of additional features 
                                            to pursue.
                                        </p><p>
                                            For carrying long, cylindrical packages, the team plans 
                                            to develop specialized holders to secure the packages and 
                                            prevent unwanted motion. These holders should be designed 
                                            with consideration of the carts overall profile for fitting 
                                            through doors and hallways.
                                        </p><p>
                                            Additionally, the team hopes to introduce more autonomous 
                                            features to the vehicle for improved usability. In general, 
                                            this will involve adding visual and proprioceptive sensors 
                                            to the vehicle to serve as inputs to the Arduino microcontroller. 
                                            Some features that the team has prioritized are automatic 
                                            braking, incline detection, and obstacle avoidance. The 
                                            ultimate goal would be for the device to follow a user 
                                            at a specified distance while autonomously navigating turns, 
                                            corners, inclines, bumps, and any other static or moving 
                                            obstacles. Safety would be of utmost importance in this 
                                            pursuit, so the team would set high standards for the 
                                            awareness and reliability of autonomous systems.
