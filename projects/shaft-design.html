                                                In a team of 3 students, I designed and machined an 
                                                aluminum prototype shaft for tensioning a machine drive. 
                                                The drive belt is tensioend by a constant force of 100 lbf
                                                and the shaft rotates between 100-300 rpm, except when undergoing 
                                                maintenance or a scheduled shutdown. The shaft 
                                                is supported by two bearings: a pillow 
                                                block bearing on one end and a ball bearing on the other.
                                                At a distance of 3.375" from one of the ends, the shaft 
                                                must interface with a 4" 32-teeth timing belt sheave. 
                                                To achieve this connection, the team selected a 15/16"
                                                quick-disconnect clamp-on bushing with 3 1/4-20 screws.
                                                12L14 steel was selected for the material of the final 
                                                shaft due primarily to its high machinability and strength. 
                                                The complete shaft assembly is shown in Figure 1.

                                                <span class="image right"><img src="../images/shaft-exploded.png" alt="" />
                                                    <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Exploded view of machine driver tensioner assembly.
                                                </span>
                                                The final cost of the machine drive tensioner assembly is 
                                                $202.54, with the shaft itself contributing just over 
                                                $15 in material cost. See Table 1 for a costed bill of 
                                                materials. Since the shaft is subjected to a high number 
                                                of cycles at a relatively low load, the primary failure mode 
                                                considered is fatigue. The shaft was computed to have an infinite 
                                                fatigue lifetime with a minimum fatigue safety factor (FSF) of 
                                                15.702 at the point of maxmimum bending moment. It is 
                                                also important to note that there is no keyway on the 
                                                shaft, as the pressured generated at the interface of the fit 
                                                between the shaft and the clamp-on bushing was determined 
                                                to be more than sufficient. Given the low torque requirements 
                                                of the shaft and the frictional force between the bushing 
                                                and the shaft, the factor of safety for maintaining no-slip 
                                                at the interface was calculated to be 90.8. An exploded view 
                                                of the machine drive tensioner assembly is shown in Figure 2.
